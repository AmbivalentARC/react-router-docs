Thanks for helping, I really appraciate it!

As I explained in the main README, I switched off the GH issues for my own productivity.

**But I absolutely don't want to discourage newcomers from contributing**. Not so long ago I was a newbie to the open source.

If you want to help, please send the PR with suggested: fixes, additions or if you want me to help you with something.

### But how do I create a PR?

There are quite a few resources which can help you. I found these very useful:

- [How to contribute to an open source project on Github](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) - in my opinion this is the best intro if you want to start contributing to any OSS project. Kudos to [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds), who did a great job with explaining things in a very simple way.
- [Proposing changes to a project with pull requests - Github docs](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)
- [Making a pull request - Atlassian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)

Or you can check other resources: http://bfy.tw/50SO

If you still find yourself struggling with contributing probably my explanation wasn't the best, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matzatorski).
