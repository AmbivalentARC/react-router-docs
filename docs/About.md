### What React Router is

React Router helps you organise your applications based on (nested) URLs.

This offers many advantages :

 - Explicit views declarations : instantly understand what are your app views
 - Restore any view + state with a simple URL (deep-linking)
 - Nested views - react-router handle nested views and their progressive resolution
 - History - User can navigate backward/forward and restore state
 - Standardized app structure and behaviour, useful when working in a team

By organising your code in such a standard way, it helps you keep a sane codebase, where your views are truly independant from the context.

### What React Router isn't

React router doesnt handle data-fetching, you have to use [async-props](https://github.com/ryanflorence/async-props) or whatever classical React data fetching mechanism.
